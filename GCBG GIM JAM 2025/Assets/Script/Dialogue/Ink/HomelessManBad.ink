    "I'm sorryâ€”I.... have nothing to spare." #Speaker:Dr.Hyde #layout:left #portrait:Dr_Hyde
    
    The homeless guy smiled wryly. #Speaker:  #portrait:default 
    
    
    "I see. Then I will remain condemned and try to survive again today." #Speaker:Homeless Man  #layout: left #portrait:HomelessMan
    
    "Thank you for the short chat, young man." #Speaker:Homeless Man  #layout: left #portrait:HomelessMan
    
    Dr. Hyde left with a grim expression on his face. #Speaker:  #portrait:default

    A strong cold storm bombarded the area later on. #Speaker:  #portrait:default 
    
    Without anything to keep himself warm..the homeless guy died due to hypothermia. #Speaker:  #portrait:default
